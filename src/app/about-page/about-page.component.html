<h2>Welcome!</h2>

    Hi, My name is Dustin Khong. In June 2019 I obtained a BS in Mathematics - Computer Science from UCSD and I'm currently seeking a full-time 
    position. I built this application to demonstrate my abilities as a software engineer. Using this application, you should be able to create 
    albums and upload pictures. There is a groups functionality which allows you to invite other users to join a group and then you can share 
    photo albums within the group. In addition, if you feel comfortable, you may share your albums publicly and then anyone can see them on the 
    "Public Albums" page. This was a fun project for me and required me to learn how to use and connect some technologies together such as 
    Spring Boot, Angular2, and MySQL.

    This web application is written using Angular and is hosted on Google's Firebase platform. HTTP requests sent from the webapp are sent
    to a Maven-built Spring Web Application I am running on Heroku. The Spring app sends queries to a MySQL Database I'm hosting. Using this 
    information, it can then make requests to a media service API I have written and hosted. That API stores and serves up the photos from a
    file system.
